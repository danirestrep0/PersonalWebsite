                <p>During my CS2340 course in Fall 2024, I worked with four other group members to create a collaborative travel app. This course teaches implementations of design strategies and patterns that are common in the workplace outside of Georgia Tech. When starting this course, there was a serious learning curve. I had not used AndroidStudio before and did not have the Java experience most others had. This simply created more of a motivation to understand! Over the course of four 2-3 week Sprints, my team was able to create a usable and attractive app. I learned UI principles as well as simple AndroidDesign. More importantly, this project allowed me to see the kind of work I could be interested in and how I can imagine creating an app from start to finish. I left this course with much more confidence about developing and gained a strong foundation in many design principles I will use in my future career.</p>
                <p>This app was created using Java in AndroidStudio.</p>
