                <p>I started at Georgia Tech in August 2024 and found that while it has always been a dream of mine to be here, I definitely mentally sugarcoated it and forgot how much work it would be!</p>
                <p>My classes were difficult, time consuming, and it often felt like I was years behind everyone else in my classes. However, throughout the semester, I learned not to compare my successes to others and that in my own way, my struggle was exactly what I was working for. My CS and Calculus classes were difficult but not impossible, and I learned that it's okay if I fail at one subject. It doesn't mean I'm a failure!</p>
                <p>I also developed a newfound appreciation for football! I have had the best time taking part in cheering on the Yellow Jackets and felt that it was a great first season for me to watch!</p>
